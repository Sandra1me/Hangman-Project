# Hangman-Project
The hangman game is about guessing the word by trying different letters. But if you reach the maximum number of allowed fails, you get hanged.
In this project, I have created the hangman game using Python code. The words to guess are in Spanish or English, and you can choose the language you wish to play.

Also, you won't be guessing the same word twice in the same gameplay, as the program eliminates already guessed words from the possible words.

## Usage
You can run the program from the main.py file. The modules it imports are saved in checks.py and words.py.

To use the program, initialize it in the terminal, and it will choose a random word from a list for you to guess. Then you can insert different letters. 
You can also insert the word you think matches the whitespaces.

The game will continue until it stays without words to guess or the user tells it to stop.

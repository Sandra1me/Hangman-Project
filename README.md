# Hangman-Project
The hangman game is about guessing the word by trying different letters. But if you reach the maximum number of allowed fails, you get hanged.
In this project, I have created the hangman game using Python code. Right now, the words to guess are only in Spanish, but I plan on implementing English words also.

You can run the program from the main.py file. The modules it imports are saved in checks.py and words.py.

## Download Code
You can download the code from this repository: https://github.com/Sandra1me/Hangman-Project

## Usage
To use the program, initialize it in the terminal, and it will choose a random word from a list for you to guess. Then you can insert different letters. 
You can also insert the word you think matches the whitespaces.

## Roadmap
I want to keep improving my code by adding the following features:
- Avoid any possible input mistakes, so we can only introduce words and letters
- Create a drawing of the hanged man for each of the failures
- Add English words to the guessing words list
- Eliminate a guessed word from the guessing list to avoid repeating words
- Create a message when the guessing list is empty, and close the game
